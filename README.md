# Taekwondo Academy — Premium Taekwondo Academy Management System

Taekwondo Academy is a state-of-the-art Single Page Application (SPA) and Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for modern Taekwondo Academy operators. It streamlines student enrollment, daily attendance check-ins, monthly expense tracking, and business metrics dashboards. Built with a premium, high-fidelity dark-mode interface, it operates seamlessly both online (with Firebase backend syncing) and offline (using localized storage fallback).

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Comprehensive Dashboard**: Real-time indicators of total active members, today's check-ins, pending fees, monthly expenses, and profit/loss metrics.
- **📅 Attendance Logger**: Easy search filter by name/mobile with single-click attendance logging for the current day.
- **👤 Student Enrollment**: Register new members, select membership duration, record fees, and document payment methods (UPI, Cash, Card, Net Banking).
- **💸 Expense Tracking**: Manage Taekwondo Academy operations costs, rent, utilities, and staff salaries.
- **📶 PWA & Smart Fallback**: Fully installable on mobile/tablet devices. Functions completely offline using local database fallbacks if no database credentials are provided.
- **🔒 Secure Authentication**: Embedded Firebase Auth for secure admin login and registration, including one-click sign-in with Google.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Single Page Application (SPA) written in semantic HTML5 and vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules).
- **Styling**: Premium custom CSS with CSS Custom Properties, smooth transitions, and glassmorphism styling.
- **Backend/Database**: Cloud Firestore & Firebase Auth (with automatic fallback to `localStorage` for offline / local-only use).
- **Offline Capabilities**: Service Workers (`sw.js`) caching core assets and an installable web app manifest (`manifest.json`).
- **Server**: Lightweight local Node.js static server for testing and routing.
